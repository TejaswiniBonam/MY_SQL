SQL Aliases
SQL aliases are used to give a table, or a column in a table, a temporary name.
Aliases are often used to make column names more readable.
An alias only exists for the duration of that query.
An alias is created with the AS keyword.


SELECT CustomerID AS ID
FROM Customers;


AS is Optional
Actually, in most database languages, you can skip the AS keyword and get the same result:


SELECT column_name(s) AS alias_name
FROM table_name;


Alias for Columns
The following SQL statement creates two aliases, one for the CustomerID column and one for the CustomerName column:


SELECT CustomerID AS ID, CustomerName AS Customer
FROM Customers;
Try to change whole table name temporarily like, select * as ABC..


Using Aliases With a Space Character
If you want your alias to contain one or more spaces, like "My Great Products", surround your alias with square brackets or double quotes.


SELECT ProductName AS [My Great Products]
FROM Products;


SELECT ProductName AS "My Great Products"
FROM Products;


WE CAN ALSO DO THIS

SELECT Column1 from table Name1;
