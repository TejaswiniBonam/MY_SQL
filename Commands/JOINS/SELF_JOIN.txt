SQL Self Join
A self join is a regular join, but the table is joined with itself.

SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table1 T1, table1 T2
WHERE condition;


T1 and T2 are different table aliases for the same table.
In SQL, the <> symbol is used to represent "not equal to". 
It is often used in a comparison expression to test whether a value is different from another value. 
For example, the expression "salary <> 50000" would test whether the salary value is not equal to 50000.


SELECT A.CustomerName AS CustomerName1, B.CustomerName AS CustomerName2, A.City
FROM Customers A, Customers B
WHERE A.CustomerID <> B.CustomerID
AND A.City = B.City
ORDER BY A.City;


Example:


CREATE TABLE GFGemployees(employee_id
INT PRIMARY KEY, employee_name VARCHAR(50), manager_id INT);
INSERT INTO GFGemployees (employee_id, employee_name, manager_id)
VALUES  (1, 'Zaid', 3),  (2, 'Rahul', 3),  (3, 'Raman', 4), 
(4, 'Kamran', NULL),  (5, 'Farhan', 4);


list of employees and their corresponding managers


SELECT e.employee_name AS employee,
m.employee_name AS managerFROM
GFGemployees AS e JOIN GFGemployees
AS m ON e.manager_id = m.employee_id;


We can do this without self join too
