The SQL IN Operator
The IN operator allows you to specify multiple values in a WHERE clause.
The IN operator is a shorthand for multiple OR conditions.
Return all customers from 'Germany', 'France', or 'UK'

SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE Country IN ('Germany', 'France', 'UK');


SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table_name
WHERE column_name IN (value1, value2, ...);


IN (SELECT) - SUB QUERY


You can also use IN with a subquery in the WHERE clause.
With a subquery you can return all records from the main query that are present in the result of the subquery.


Return all customers that have an order in the Orders table:
SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE CustomerID IN (SELECT CustomerID FROM Orders);
