NOT IN
By using the NOT keyword in front of the IN operator, you return all records that are NOT any of the values in the list.
Return all customers that are NOT from 'Germany', 'France', or 'UK':


SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE Country NOT IN ('Germany', 'France', 'UK');

NOT IN (SELECT) - SUB QUERY

The result in the example above returned 74 records, that means that there are 17 customers that haven't placed any orders.
Let us check if that is correct, by using the NOT IN operator.
Return all customers that have NOT placed any orders in the Orders table:

SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE CustomerID NOT IN (SELECT CustomerID FROM Orders);
