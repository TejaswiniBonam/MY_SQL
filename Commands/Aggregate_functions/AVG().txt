The SQL AVG() Function
The AVG() function returns the average value of a numeric column.
Find the average price of all products:


SELECT AVG(Price)
FROM Products;


Note: NULL values are ignored.


SELECT AVG(column_name)
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;


Add a WHERE Clause
You can add a WHERE clause to specify conditions:


SELECT AVG(Price)
FROM Products
WHERE CategoryID = 1;


Use an Alias
Give the AVG column a name by using the AS keyword
Name the column "average price":


SELECT AVG(Price) AS [average price]
FROM Products;


Higher Than Average
To list all records with a higher price than average, we can use the AVG() function in a sub query:
Return all products with a higher price than the average price:


SELECT * FROM Products
WHERE price > (SELECT AVG(price) FROM Products);




Use AVG() with GROUP BY
Here we use the AVG() function and the GROUP BY clause, to return the average price for each category in the Products table:


SELECT AVG(Price) AS AveragePrice, CategoryID
FROM Products
GROUP BY CategoryID;
