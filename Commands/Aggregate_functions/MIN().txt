MIN() - returns the smallest value within the selected column

Find the lowest price in the Price column:
SELECT MIN(Price)
FROM Products;


Syntax
SELECT MIN(column_name)
	FROM table_name
	WHERE condition;


Set Column Name (Alias)
When you use MIN() or MAX(), the returned column will not have a descriptive name. To give the column a descriptive name, use the AS keyword:
SELECT MIN(Price) AS SmallestPrice
FROM Products;
So the output will come as a column with column heading as “Smallest Price”


Use MIN() with GROUP BY
Here we use the MIN() function and the GROUP BY clause, to return the smallest price for each category in the Products table:
SELECT MIN(Price) AS SmallestPrice, CategoryID
FROM Products
GROUP BY CategoryID;
