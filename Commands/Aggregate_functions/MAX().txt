MAX() - returns the largest value within the selected column

Find the highest price in the Price column:
SELECT MAX(Price)
FROM Products;


Syntax

SELECT MAX(column_name)
	FROM table_name
	WHERE condition;


Set Column Name (Alias)
When you use MAX(), the returned column will not have a descriptive name. To give the column a descriptive name, use the AS keyword:
SELECT MAX(Price) AS LargestPrice
FROM Products;

So the output will come as a column with column heading as “Largest Price”


Use MAX() with GROUP BY

Here we use the MAX() function and the GROUP BY clause, to return the largest price for each category in the Products table:

SELECT MAX(Price) AS SmallestPrice, CategoryID
FROM Products
GROUP BY CategoryID;
