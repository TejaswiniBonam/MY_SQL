The SQL COUNT() Function

The COUNT() function returns the number of rows that matches a specified criterion.


Find the total number of rows in the Products table:

SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM Products;


Syntax

SELECT COUNT(column_name)
	FROM table_name
	WHERE condition;


Specify Column

You can specify a column name instead of the asterix symbol (*).
If you specify a column name instead of (*), NULL values will not be counted.


Find the number of products where the ProductName is not null:

SELECT COUNT(ProductName)
FROM Products;


Add a WHERE Clause

You can add a WHERE clause to specify conditions:

Find the number of products where Price is higher than 20:
SELECT COUNT(ProductID)
FROM Products
WHERE Price > 20;




Ignore Duplicates

You can ignore duplicates by using the DISTINCT keyword in the COUNT() function.
If DISTINCT is specified, rows with the same value for the specified column will be counted as one.


How many different prices are there in the Products table:

SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT Price)
FROM Products;


Use an Alias

Give the counted column a name by using the AS keyword.
Name the column "Number of records":

SELECT COUNT(*) AS [Number of records]
FROM Products;


Use COUNT() with GROUP BY
Here we use the COUNT() function and the GROUP BY clause, to return the number of records for each category in the Products table:


SELECT COUNT(*) AS [Number of records], CategoryID
FROM Products
GROUP BY CategoryID;
