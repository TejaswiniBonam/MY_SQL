The _ Wildcard
The _ wildcard represents a single character.
It can be any character or number, but each _ represents one, and only one, character.
Return all customers from a city that starts with 'L' followed by one wildcard character, then 'nd' and then two wildcard characters:


SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE city LIKE 'L_nd__';
