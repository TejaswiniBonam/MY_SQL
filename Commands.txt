SELECT * FROM Customers;
SELECT CustomerName, City FROM Customers;


SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name;



The SELECT DISTINCT statement is used to return only distinct (different) values.

SELECT DISTINCT Country FROM Customers;

Inside a table, a column often contains many duplicate values; and sometimes you only want to list the different (distinct) values.


SELECT DISTINCT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name;
